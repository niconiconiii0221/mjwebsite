<div class="wrapper-main"><p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;"> <br> <br> <br> Michael Jackson, born on August 29, 1958, was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. He is often referred to as the "King of Pop" and is one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion have made him a global figure in popular culture.
    Jackson first gained fame as a member of the Jackson 5, a Motown group formed with his siblings. He began his solo career in the early 1970s and released a series of successful albums, including "Off the Wall" (1979) and "Thriller" (1982). "Thriller" became the best-selling album of all time and produced several chart-topping singles, including the iconic title track and "Billie Jean."
    
    Apart from his musical achievements, Jackson was known for his innovative music videos, such as the groundbreaking video for "Thriller," which featured elaborate dance routines and special effects. He popularized the moonwalk, a dance move that became his signature.
    
    Jackson's influence extended beyond music and dance; he was also involved in humanitarian efforts and charitable causes. However, his later years were marred by controversy and legal challenges, including allegations of child molestation, of which he was acquitted in 2005.
    
    Tragically, Michael Jackson passed away on June 25, 2009, at the age of 50. Despite the controversies surrounding his life, his contributions to the music industry and his impact on popular culture continue to be celebrated by fans worldwide.
